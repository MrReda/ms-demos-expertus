# ms-demos-expertus
This repository will contain a brief demonstration for the company Expertus

This project contains two microservices and based on the architecture cqrs.

I used in memory store functionnality due to the lack of a free time :).

First of all ,you have to launch the service discrovery Eureka,which is under expertus-ms-services (expertus-eureka).

Once the service discovery is up and running,you only need to register zuul as a gateway under expertus-ms-services.

Now you have the pre-required services.

Launch your microservices ms-account-query under ms-account in addition to the ms-customer-query (ms-customer).

Still to come,once a free time comes out :
NoSql db
OAuth
Mustachifier
Docker
Jenkins
Tdd,Bdd
Validator framework
Try framework
...


Here you go :)

Let me know ,if you need something.
